Rased ( which means monitor in English) is an app created by students from Yemen. 😃😍 Ideally, people should know about natural disasters and disasters made by humans such as avalanches, floods, or even car accidents 😨. if we can not prevent them, at least we can avoid them. However, because of the absence of knowing the occurrence of the disasters and the lack of awareness, unfortunately, people die and get hurt, businesses lose and shut down, and properties get destroyed. So what if we can minimize the damage and perhaps eliminate the risk? 🤔

The UN Sustainable Develop Goals we hope that the app would solve are Climate ✅ action, life on land 💚, and partnerships 🌐. the main idea of the solution is to reduce the negative effect of climate change and disasters.
